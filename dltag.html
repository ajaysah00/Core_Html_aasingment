        <dt>Mean Stack</dt>
        <dd>The MEAN stack is a popular full-stack development stack that consists of MongoDB (for the database), Express.js (for the server framework), Angular (for the front-end framework), and Node.js (for the runtime environment). It's commonly used for building dynamic web applications.</dd>
   <br>
    <dt>Mern Stack</dt>
    <dd> The MERN stack is another popular full-stack development stack that includes MongoDB (for the database), Express.js (for the server framework), React (for the front-end library), and Node.js (for the runtime environment). It's used for building modern and interactive web applications.</dd>

    <dt>Lamp Stack</dt>
    <dd>The LAMP stack is a classic full-stack development stack consisting of Linux (the operating system), Apache (the web server), MySQL (for the database), and PHP (for the server-side scripting language). It has been widely used for building dynamic websites and web applications.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt>Jam Stack</dt>
    <dd>JAMstack is a modern web development architecture that stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It relies on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and pre-built Markup to create fast and secure web applications. This approach decouples the front end from the back end, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt>Ruby on Rails</dt>
    <dd>Ruby on Rails, often called Rails, is a full-stack web development framework that uses the Ruby programming language. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and is known for its convention over configuration (CoC) and don't repeat yourself (DRY) principles, making it a powerful and developer-friendly choice for building web applications.</dd>
